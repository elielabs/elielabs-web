### Your AI stack is strong. But is your workflow connected?

Individual tools like **Notion**, **ChatGPT**, and **Gemini** are incredibly powerful, yet they often live in silos. You waste time copy-pasting and toggling between tabs.

**That’s where Elie Labs comes in.**

We don't just build extensions. We build **Bridges**. Our mission is to turn standalone point solutions into a unified **Productivity Ecosystem** right inside your browser. We help solopreneurs and agile teams stop "managing tools" and start "flowing."

<br/>

### We believe in transparency

Our Roadmap is officially public. This is our blueprint for connecting the dots between the AI tools you use every day.
