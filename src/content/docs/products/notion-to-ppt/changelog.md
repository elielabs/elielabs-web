## v1.0.0 (The Power Duo Launch)
**Released:** December 18, 2025

We are excited to launch V1.0.0! This release is designed to save **Project Managers** hours of work by instantly converting Notion project boards into professional PowerPoint slides.

### Major Features
- **The Power Duo:** Launched the "Smart Project Tracker" template alongside the extension.
- **Smart Mapping:** The extension is now optimized to map specific template columns (Status, Priority, Due Date) directly to PowerPoint layouts.
- **Priority Handling:** Added specific support for P0/P1 tags to visually highlight critical items in the slides.

### Known Limitations
- V1.0.0 is currently optimized **exclusively** for the "Smart Project Tracker" template structure to ensure perfect formatting. Custom database mapping will be supported in future versions.
